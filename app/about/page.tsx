        Founded over 30 years ago in Minneapolis, Minnesota, MythGuard is the
        world’s first — and only — official agency dedicated to integrating
        Mythical Guardians into human society. These extraordinary beings have
        long walked among us, hidden behind ancient veils of secrecy and
        illusion. While their origins remain a tightly kept secret, a select few
        have stepped forward, choosing to live and work openly alongside humans.

        With a growing roster of Guardians, our Minneapolis headquarters serves
        as a hub for hiring, training, and even culture-sharing events —
        including our popular Guardian Nutrition Exhibitions where humans can
        sample otherworldly delicacies.
