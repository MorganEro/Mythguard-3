# Troubleshooting Log

## March 19, 2025 - Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue

### Problem
- Error: "Can't resolve 'tailwindcss'" in globals.css
- Issue appeared during Prisma integration work
- Previous working state had functioning Tailwind CSS

### Investigation
1. Package Version Analysis
   - Found multiple Tailwind versions installed
   - Initial confusion about @tailwindcss/postcss version number
   - Verified compatibility between packages

2. Configuration Check
   - Confirmed correct import syntax in globals.css: `@import "tailwindcss"`
   - Verified PostCSS configuration
   - Checked Tailwind config settings

### Resolution
Working configuration preserved in git commit `5f1dc69`:

1. Package Versions:
   ```json
   {
     "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1",
     "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.0.11",
     "postcss": "^8.5.3"
   }
   ```

2. Key Files:
   - globals.css: Uses `@import "tailwindcss"`
   - postcss.config.mjs: Configured with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
   - tailwind.config.ts: Set up for Next.js app directory

### Key Learnings
1. The @tailwindcss/postcss version number (4.0.11) does not indicate a requirement for Tailwind v4
2. The modern `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax is correct
3. Package version numbers don't need to match between tailwindcss and @tailwindcss/postcss

### How to Find This Configuration
1. Git commit with detailed configuration is tagged with "feat(config): establish working Tailwind CSS configuration"
2. Use `git log --grep="Tailwind"` to find this commit
3. Configuration files are preserved in this state
